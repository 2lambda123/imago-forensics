# imago-forensics üïµÔ∏è
Imago is a python tool for extracting digital evidence from images recursively.
This  tool can be useful during a digital forensic investigation, where you have a lot of images and you need to extract metadata information in order to compare the images and find evidences.

# Installation

## Installation of the requirements via pip:

To install imago requirements simply run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Requirements:
```
python 2.7
exifread version 2.1.2
python-magic version 0.4.15
argparse version 1.2.1
```
# Usage

```
usage: imago.py [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] [-s {yes}] [-t {jpeg,tiff}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output directory path
  -s {yes}, --sqli {yes}
                        Keep SQLite file
  -t {jpeg,tiff}, --type {jpeg,tiff}
                        image type, can be JPEG or TIFF, if this argument it
                        is not provided, imago will process all the image types(i.e. JPEG, TIFF)
```
The only required argument is -i which is the base directory

# Example

```
python imago.py -i /home/solvent/cases/c23/DCIM/ -o /home/solvent/cases/c23/ -s yes -t jpeg
```

Where:
* -i path: is the base directory, where imago will search for file
* -o path: the output directory where imago will save the CSV file, with the extracted metadata
* -s yes: the temporary SQLite database will not be deleted after the processing.
* -t jpeg: imago will search only for jpeg images.
